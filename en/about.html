      <h1>About Dr.Wound</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>It all started in 1998 with a joke about “9 wounds” that changed a physician’s life.</p>
        <p>At the time, I was a chief resident treating a 70-year-old woman with multiple diabetic foot wounds—9 of them. I jokingly said, “Granny, you’re so generous, giving me 9 abalones again!” (a pun in Taiwanese).</p>
        <p>That joke sparked a lifelong passion for wound care, leading me to pioneer advanced healing strategies across Taiwan.</p>
